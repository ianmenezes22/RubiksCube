As part of our assignment for CSC 520 Artificial Intelligence - I at NCSU, we had to develop a code to solve the Globe version of Rubik’s cube. We had to solve the cube using three search techniques - BFS, A* and Recursive Best-First-Search. 

You’re given a set of locations where the current tiles reside at, and you need to get them to their original location which is specified along with it.

The problem description is uploaded along with the solution implemented by me. Along with the test files.
